# TODO: Plan-Build-Test Improvements

## 1. Refactor Main P-B-T Project

### Code Organization
- [ ] Split orchestrator.js into smaller modules (it's currently 2000+ lines)
  - `orchestrator-core.js` - Main orchestration logic
  - `claude-client.js` - Claude API interaction
  - `project-state.js` - State management
  - `task-runner.js` - Task execution logic
  - `test-runner.js` - Test execution logic
  - `file-utils.js` - File system utilities

### Error Handling Improvements
- [ ] Add better recovery mechanisms for partial failures
- [ ] Implement checkpoint/resume functionality at task level
- [ ] Add rollback capability when tasks fail
- [ ] Better handling of rate limits and API timeouts

### Configuration
- [ ] Move hardcoded values to configuration file
- [ ] Support for different Claude models via config
- [ ] Configurable timeouts and retry limits
- [ ] Environment-specific settings

## 2. Create Test Suite for P-B-T

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test ProjectState class methods
- [ ] Test file parsing utilities
- [ ] Test agent response parsing
- [ ] Test task reconstruction logic

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test full create-project flow
- [ ] Test fix command with various failure scenarios
- [ ] Test backlog processing and resumption
- [ ] Test npm install integration

### E2E Tests
- [ ] Create sample projects and verify output
- [ ] Test failure recovery scenarios
- [ ] Test concurrent backlog processing
- [ ] Verify git integration works correctly

## 3. Better Backlog Selection

### Intelligent Backlog Generation
- [ ] Analyze project complexity to determine appropriate backlog sizes
- [ ] Better task estimation (lines of code, complexity)
- [ ] Smarter dependency detection between backlogs
- [ ] Template-based backlog suggestions for common project types

### Backlog Prioritization
- [ ] Add priority scoring algorithm
- [ ] Consider dependencies when selecting next backlog
- [ ] Allow user to reorder/reprioritize backlogs
- [ ] Show estimated time/complexity for each backlog

### Backlog Validation
- [ ] Validate backlog size before processing (not too large/small)
- [ ] Check for circular dependencies
- [ ] Ensure acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] Warn about overly complex backlogs

## 4. Test npm run refactor

### Current Issues to Test
- [ ] Does refactor command properly analyze code?
- [ ] Are refactoring suggestions practical?
- [ ] Does it maintain functionality after refactoring?
- [ ] How does it handle complex codebases?

### Improvements Needed
- [ ] Better code analysis before refactoring
- [ ] Incremental refactoring with testing between steps
- [ ] Preserve comments and documentation
- [ ] Generate refactoring report/changelog

## 5. Additional Improvements

### Performance
- [ ] Cache Claude responses for similar prompts
- [ ] Parallel task execution where possible
- [ ] Optimize file reading/writing operations
- [ ] Reduce prompt sizes by better context selection

### User Experience
- [ ] Progress indicators for long operations
- [ ] Better command-line help and examples
- [ ] Interactive mode for ambiguous situations
- [ ] Generate project documentation automatically

### Reliability
- [ ] Add health checks before starting operations
- [ ] Verify Claude CLI is properly configured
- [ ] Check disk space before operations
- [ ] Validate project structure before processing
